Scriptable User Introduction _ En
*** This Project is in remake! The command may changes anytime. ***
	You can found that the namespace is greatly changed to be more readable, much longer though.
	I strongly suggest you use the longer version, because it is much more readable.

A multifunction Scriptable Tool to allow users to script what their computers can automaticly do.

script extensions: *.sru, *.srux, *.srup;
 - (Scriptable User Script, Scriptable User Executable, Scriptable User Package)

Allows you to do multiple things:
· Run script(s) or program(s) automaticly at set time.
· Send virtural mouse &/ keyboard message, to the display, the whole screen or the single window.
        Send message to a single window allows it to be sent when the window is not on the top.
        Really useful when you are doing something repeatedly.
· Start a program or kill it.
· Shutdown, Sleep or lock your pc.
· Much more for you to explore!

Note: The script host will exit if it cannot understand a line. To let it continues if it's not important, use "environment StopOnError false".
  Now the commands are case-sensitive. However, the "shell:Run" command uses the windows shell, which is case-insensitive.

Command List:
0x0   // ;			Comments, which will be ignored. The mark(s) must be at the beginning of a line.
						Sadly that we do not support in-line comments currently, Since that need to re-built the parsing system.
